# Capacitor Physical Properties Analyzer

![Capacitor Banner](https://c1.wallpaperflare.com/preview/442/803/728/electronics-capacitor-component-circuit.jpg)

This application is crafted to visualize and analyze the physical properties of three distinct capacitor types: parallel plate, spherical, and cylindrical. Proudly developed by **Madeline Castro** and **Xavier López**, passionate CS & TI and physics students from Universidad del Valle de Guatemala.

## Overview

The interface offers users the flexibility to tweak dimensions, voltage, and the presence of a dielectric. Depending on the configuration, the program showcases real-time updates on the physical properties and provides a graphical cross-sectional view of the chosen capacitor.

## Emphasis on Accuracy

In computational physics, it is pivotal to discern between accuracy and precision. Due to inherent constraints in numerical methods, some results might slightly drift from the "true" values. Nonetheless, this doesn't necessarily undercut their precision.

For instance, while calculating the capacitance and charge distribution, our application employs advanced numerical techniques ensuring that the estimations are bound within a minimal error threshold. This strives to attain high precision, even if the results can't be pinpoint accurate because of the limitations of computational methods.

## Features

- Dynamic interface allowing users to select capacitor type and define its parameters.
- Graphical visualization of the chosen capacitor with a cross-sectional image.
- Real-time updates showcasing the alteration in physical properties with parameter tweaks.
- Harnesses the power of advanced programming libraries for GUI, computation, and visualization.
