# physical-properties-of-a-capacitor
Create a user-friendly graphical interface for analyzing three capacitor types: parallel plate, spherical, and cylindrical. The interface allows users to customize dimensions, voltage, and dielectric presence, displaying real-time updates of physical properties and a cross-sectional capacitor image.
